# BSale Test API

This is the api for the Bsale Test App, challenge to BSale made by David Montoya

This REST API was made using Node.Js and Javascript as main language. Also with a provided MySqL Database, ExpressJS and dependencies such as nodemon, mysql and promise-mysql. Basically, we build a online store, where we can see the products, search and filter by category.
